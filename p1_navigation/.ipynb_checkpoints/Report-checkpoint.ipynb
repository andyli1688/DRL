    "* ### Algorithm - DQN Implementation\n",
    "This project implements a *Value Based* method called [Deep Q-Networks](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/). \n",
    "\n",
    "    Deep Q Learning combines 2 approaches :\n",
    "    - A Reinforcement Learning method called [Q Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) (aka SARSA max)\n",
    "    - A Deep Neural Network to learn a Q-table approximation (action-values)\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially, this implementation includes the 2 major training improvements by [Deepmind](https://deepmind.com) and described in their [Nature publication : \"Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning (2015)\"](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf)\n",
    "    - Experience Replay \n",
    "    - Fixed Q Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "> Reinforcement learning is known to be unstable or even to diverge when a nonlinear function approximator such as a neural network is used to represent the action-value (also known as Q) function20. This instability has several causes: the correlations present in the sequence of observations, the fact that small updates to Q may significantly change the policy and therefore change the data distribution, and the correlations\n",
    "between the action-values and the target values .\n",
    "We address these instabilities with a novel variant of Q-learning, which uses two key ideas. First, we used a biologically inspired mechanism termed experience replay that randomizes over the data, thereby removing correlations in the observation sequence and smoothing over changes in the data distribution. Second, we used an iterative update that adjusts the action-values towards target values that are only periodically updated, thereby reducing correlations with the target.\n",
